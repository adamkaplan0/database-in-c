 PART 2:

 What grade did C. Brown get in CS101? A
 Where is C. Brown on Mondays at 9AM? Turing Aud.
 
 PART 3:

 Union of two SNAP tables, which are slightly different:
 Original:
 StudentId = 22222
 Name = P. Patty
 Address = 56 Grape Blvd.
 Phone = 555-9999


 StudentId = 12345
 Name = C. Brown
 Address = 12 Apple St.
 Phone = 555-1234


 StudentId = 67890
 Name = L. Van Pelt
 Address = 34 Pear Ave.
 Phone = 555-5678


 Different:
 StudentId = 22223
 Name = P. Patty Different
 Address = 56 Grape Blvd.
 Phone = 555-9999


 StudentId = 12346
 Name = C. Brown Different
 Address = 12 Apple St.
 Phone = 555-1234


 StudentId = 67891
 Name = L. Van Pelt Different
 Address = 34 Pear Ave.
 Phone = 555-5678


 Union:
 StudentId = 22222
 Name = P. Patty
 Address = 56 Grape Blvd.
 Phone = 555-9999


 StudentId = 22223
 Name = P. Patty Different
 Address = 56 Grape Blvd.
 Phone = 555-9999


 StudentId = 12345
 Name = C. Brown
 Address = 12 Apple St.
 Phone = 555-1234


 StudentId = 12346
 Name = C. Brown Different
 Address = 12 Apple St.
 Phone = 555-1234


 StudentId = 67890
 Name = L. Van Pelt
 Address = 34 Pear Ave.
 Phone = 555-5678


 StudentId = 67891
 Name = L. Van Pelt Different
 Address = 34 Pear Ave.
 Phone = 555-5678


 Intersection of two CR tables, which are slightly different:
 Original:
 Course = CS101
 Room = Turing Aud.


 Course = EE200
 Room = 25 Ohm Hall


 Course = PH100
 Room = Newton Lab


 Different:
 Course = CS101
 Room = Turing Aud.


 Course = EE201
 Room = 25 Ohm Hall


 Course = PH100
 Room = Newton Lab


 Intersection:
 Course = CS101
 Room = Turing Aud.


 Course = PH100
 Room = Newton Lab


 Difference of two CR tables, which are slightly different:
 Original:
 Course = CS101
 Room = Turing Aud.


 Course = EE200
 Room = 25 Ohm Hall


 Course = PH100
 Room = Newton Lab


 Different:
 Course = CS101
 Room = Turing Aud.


 Course = EE201
 Room = 25 Ohm Hall


 Course = PH100
 Room = Newton Lab


 Difference:
 Course = EE200
 Room = 25 Ohm Hall


 Selecting Course = CS101 from CSG:

 Course = CS101
 StudentId = 33333
 Grade = A-


 Course = CS101
 StudentId = 12345
 Grade = A


 Course = CS101
 StudentId = 67890
 Grade = B


 Projecting only the StudentIds from the previous table:

 StudentId = 33333


 StudentId = 12345


 StudentId = 67890


 Joining CDH and CR on Course:

 Course = CS101
 Day = M
 Hour = 9AM
 Room = Turing Aud.


 Course = CS101
 Day = W
 Hour = 9AM
 Room = Turing Aud.


 Course = CS101
 Day = F
 Hour = 9AM
 Room = Turing Aud.


 Course = EE200
 Day = Tu
 Hour = 10AM
 Room = 25 Ohm Hall


 Course = EE200
 Day = W
 Hour = 1PM
 Room = 25 Ohm Hall


 Course = EE200
 Day = Th
 Hour = 10AM
 Room = 25 Ohm Hall


 Projecting Day, Hour from The selection of Room=Turing Aud. from the Join of CR and CDH;

 Day = M
 Hour = 9AM


 Day = W
 Hour = 9AM


 Day = F
 Hour = 9AM
